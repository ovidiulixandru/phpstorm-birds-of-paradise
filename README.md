Birds of Paradise color scheme for phpStorm
==========================
This scheme is a port of the amazing Birds of Paradise theme created by [Joe Bergantine]("http://joebergantine.com") for [TextMate]("http://joebergantine.com/werkstatt/birds-of-paradise-for-textmate") and [Coda]("http://joebergantine.com/werkstatt/birds-of-paradise"). All credits and awe go to him.

It is not an exact replica because of the different mappings in phpStorm than the other two programs. Also, it's not a complete port because I worked only on the languages I'm using (namely PHP, HTML, CSS, Smarty, Apache). So if you want to contribute, you're most welcome.

Enjoy.
